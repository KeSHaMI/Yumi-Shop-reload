# Yumi-Shop-reload
Reincarnation of 2 month old project(was private repository)

Previously i was using really strange constructions to save user's input without rewriting variables (in telebot variables are common)
This time i used MongoDB(really like it) and have written this ~500 lines bot in 10 hours

Decided to share my code, because I think it's not that hard to understand and it has solutions for a lot of problems I've solved during my bot wrriting experience and, hopefully, can save a lot of time for someone

Note: Tovar(s) == product(s)(for those whose native language doesn't give an opportunity to understand this)
